          <h1 class="test">Students for Justice Clothing (2010-2012)</h1>
          <p>I helped start a non-profit organization that specialized in printing and distribution of sweatshop free clothing that was printed and pressed out of a basement in Mississauga. We had supplied local high schools in Mississauga with gym attire and had an e-commerce website that handled our online sales. </p>

          <h1 class="test">Culinary Involvement</h1>
          <p>I was in dire need of a part time job in high school and was told that the Kelsey's in my neighbourhood was looking for line cooks. Seriously doubting my culinary skills at the moment, I had started off working my way up the kitchen and eventually got as involved as moving to different restaurants like Montana's and Red Lobster. Eventually working my way to being a part time sous-chef at Earl's.</p>

          <h1 class="test">Engineering Innovations</h1>
          <p>As an engineering student, I get easily excited when the opportunity to build or design something cool arises. I helped design and build a workout bench for people with impaired mobility which was tested and used with a physiotherapic clinic at Queen's University. I was also part of a team that designed a net-zero solar powered house on campus that had also been featured in a competition for net-zero structures.</p>
