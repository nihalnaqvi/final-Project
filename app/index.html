          <p>I am currently a student attending Queen's University, studying chemical engineering. I am currently in my third year of school. </p>

          <p>I enjoy travelling extensively, hence had to miss the first class as I was away at that time. I am obsessed with cars as well, my all time favourite being the Nissan GTR.</p>

          <p>I decided to take this class as there is a large aspect to coding in engineering, specifically chemical engineering. I have previously learnt Robot-C language and have started to teach myself Python. I plan to use coding to my advantage in order to open up various opportunities for myself. I enjoy a variety of different sports and often never fail to keep myself active. Some sports that I enjoy are skiing, volleyball, swimming, tennis and golf. I work as a ski instructor and coach in the winter during my breaks and would like to achieve my PPL (Private Pilots License) this summer.</p>
